# PID-Controller-Based-on-a-Self-Adaptive-Neural-Network
This is implementation of the research paper _PID Controller Based on a Self-Adaptive Neural Network to Ensure QoS Bandwidth Requirements in Passive Optical Networks_. 
The current code takes error input as a sequence. and provides us with Kp, Kd and Ki values as an output. The network is implemented by convolution methord.
You can refer code for further clarity.
